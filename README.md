ShieldStack
ShieldStack is a universal, hardware-agnostic embedded security platform designed to provide secure boot, firmware signing, key management, and runtime validation across multiple embedded platforms.

Our goal is to enable embedded device manufacturers to implement robust security features with minimal effort, reducing development time and increasing trustworthiness.

Features (MVP)
Secure Boot configuration and validation

Firmware image signing and verification

Key generation and management CLI tools

Support for i.MX8MP (Microprocessor) and STM32 (Microcontroller)

Modular, pluggable architecture designed for extensibility
